                BrightLife Enhancement Services provides ASAM Level 3.1
                Residential Supportive Housing for individuals recovering from
                substance use disorders. This program is designed for clients
                who require a safe, supportive, and structured living
                environment but do not need 24-hour medical or psychiatric care.
                The program focuses on stability, community reintegration,
