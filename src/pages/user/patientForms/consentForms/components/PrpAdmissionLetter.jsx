                We are pleased to welcome you to the Psychiatric Rehabilitation
                Program (PRP) at BrightLife Enhancement Services. After a
                careful review of the referral from your mental health provider,
                your psychiatric rehabilitation assessment, background history,
                and feedback from Carelon (Maryland Medicaid), we are happy to
                inform you that you have been formally admitted into the PRP
                program.
