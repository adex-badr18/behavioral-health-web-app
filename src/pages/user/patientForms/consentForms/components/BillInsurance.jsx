                I, the undersigned, hereby certify and attest that I have sought
                evaluation, treatment, or medical advice from the staff at the
                clinic named above. I therefore authorize the medical staff and
                personnel to release me or my minor childâ€™s medical information
                to the insurance company listed above for the purpose of
                determining and receiving benefits for medical bills.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
                I understand and acknowledge that the medical staff will submit
                my claim to the insurance company on my behalf. I further
                understand that I will be held responsible for any amount of
                medical bills not covered by my insurance policy or claims, and
                that I will be responsible for paying all deductibles, fees,
                co-payments, and co-insurance payments required.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
                I understand that any portion of my medical bills not covered by
                insurance will be billed to me at the address I have provided
                above. Non-compliance or defaulting on payments may result in
                denial of service and/or legal claims against me for
                non-payment.
