                    <strong>Description:</strong> The Symptom Checklist is an
                    instrument consisting of the eighteen DSM-IV-TR criteria.
                    Six of the eighteen questions were found to be the most
                    predictive of symptoms consistent with ADHD. These six
                    questions are the basis for the ASRS v1.1 Screener and are
                    also Part A of the Symptom Checklist. Part B of the Symptom
                    Checklist contains the remaining twelve questions.
